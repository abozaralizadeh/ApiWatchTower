AWT is an open-source Django application for deep real-time API monitoring by periodical calls and evaluating the results, not only as a health checker but also for controlling the integrity and getting alerts in case of any unexpected changes to the result payload itself. Aimed to use along with other tools like Grafana to visualise the data and setting alert systems.

To see the demo without applying any configuration, you can use the single container here: [abo0zar/single_awt](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/abo0zar/single_awt)


## Installation

The easiest way to setup is using the docker container ([abo0zar/api_watch_tower:latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/abo0zar/api_watch_tower)) using the following Yaml file:



```yml
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=AWT
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    volumes:
      - postgresData:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    expose:
      - "5432"

  redis:
    image: redis
    restart: always
    command: redis-server
    expose:
      - "6379"

  awt_admin:
    image: abo0zar/api_watch_tower:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: "abozar_app_django"
    command: bash -c 'python manage.py migrate auth && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000'
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    environment:
      - AAD_TENANT_ID=xxxOptionalxxx
      - AAD_CLIENT_ID=xxxOptionalxxx
      - HTTPS=off

  awt_worker:
    image: abo0zar/api_watch_tower:latest
    command: celery -A ApiWatchTower worker -B --concurrency=10
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - postgres
      - awt_admin

  awt_scheduler:
    image: abo0zar/api_watch_tower:latest
    restart: always
    command: celery -A ApiWatchTower beat -l info -S django --pidfile=
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - postgres
      - awt_admin
      - awt_worker

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: "awt_grafana"
    volumes:
      - grafanaStorage:/var/lib/grafana
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

volumes:
    postgresData:
    grafanaStorage:

```

## Requirements

AWT works with Postgres as the database and to monitor the results you can use grafana. 
Also Redis is used as a broker for AWT celery workers. use nginx to serve both AWT and Grafana on the same port if needed, in that case yu need to run grafana behind a reverse proxy,
visit grafana documentation to achieve to that goal here: [run grafana behind a proxy](https://grafana.com/tutorials/run-grafana-behind-a-proxy/#2)

## Configurations

The following environment variables can be passed to all the containers that use AWT docker image:

#### HTTPS
**default:** off
Can have the values 'on' and 'off'

#### AWT_REDIS_HOST
**default:** redis

#### AWT_REDIS_PORT
**default:** 6379

#### AWT_LANGUAGE_CODE
**default:** it

#### AWT_TIME_ZONE
**default:** Europe/Rome

#### AWT_PG_DBNAME
**default:** AWT

#### AWT_PG_USERNAME
**default:** postgres

#### AWT_PG_PASSWORD
**default:** postgres

#### AWT_PG_HOST
**default:** postgres

#### AWT_PG_PORT
**default:** 5432

There are also some settings related to the configuration of Azure Active Directory login that can be find here: [django-azure-ad-auth](https://github.com/abozaralizadeh/django-azure-ad-auth)

Also to configure Grafana you can visit the official documentations but some useful configurations are suggested here:

#### GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER
#### GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD
#### GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL
#### GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS
